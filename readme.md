# ZetaChain Template

[ZetaChain](https://www.zetachain.com) is a blockchain for [universal
apps](https://www.zetachain.com/docs/developers/apps/intro/) that span across
any blockchain, from Ethereum and Cosmos to Bitcoin and beyond.

This template is designed to help developers quickly set up and build universal
applications on ZetaChain, providing a structured starting point with
pre-configured tools and libraries.Our templates and tools are designed to give
you a great developer experience, so you can focus more on building and less on
setup.

# Prerequisites

- Node.js
- `npm` or `yarn`

## Project Structure

### Contracts

The [`contracts`](contracts) directory contains a smart contract template that
uses Solidity and Hardhat and is compatible with Foundry. The contracts template
leverages [`@zetachain/toolkit`](https://github.com/zeta-chain/toolkit) for
helpers, tools, and tasks.

tutorials**](https://www.zetachain.com/docs/developers/tutorials/intro/) to
start building universal app contracts.

### Web

The [`web`](web) directory contains a web template that uses Next.js,
RainbowKit, and Wagmi. The web template utilizes the
[`@zetachain/universalkit`](https://github.com/zeta-chain/universalkit)
component library.
